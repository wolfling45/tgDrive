## Deployment Methods

### Docker Compose Deployment

>[!TIP]
>📌 **Note**: If your server has limited memory (RAM ≤ 512MB), it's recommended to use the `nanyangzesi/tgdrive:server-latest` image

1. Create `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   services:
     tgdrive:
       image: nanyangzesi/tgdrive:latest
       container_name: tgdrive
       ports:
         - "8085:8085"
       volumes:
         - ./db:/app/db
       restart: always
   ```

2. Start the service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Updating the Image

When using volume mounting, after each image update, you only need to pull the image and restart the container. The database data will not be lost:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### Docker Deployment

Basic deployment command:

```bash
docker pull nanyangzesi/tgdrive:latest
docker run -d -p 8085:8085 --name tgdrive --restart always nanyangzesi/tgdrive:latest
```

#### Migrating Previous Data

If you've run the project before and generated database files in the container, you can manually migrate this data to a persistent directory on the host:

1. Find the old container's ID or name:

   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

2. Copy the database files from the container to the host:

   ```bash
   docker cp <container-name-or-ID>:/app/db ./db
   ```

   - Replace `<container-name-or-ID>` with the actual container identifier.
   - Copy the contents of the `/app/db` folder in the container to the `db` folder in the current directory on the host.

3. Restart the project:

   Use the updated `docker-compose.yml` and restart the project:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Verify the data:

   After startup, the project should be able to read the data from the `./db` folder on the host.

### Self-Deployment

Prerequisites:

- Java 17 or higher version

Deployment steps:

1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/SkyDependence/tgDrive/releases) to download the latest binary package.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded binary package.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   java -jar [latest-binary-package-name]
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   java -jar tgDrive-0.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

4. After successful execution, visit `localhost:8085` in your browser to start using.

## Advanced Configuration

### PicGo Configuration

> [!TIP]
> Supported from v0.0.4+ onwards.

This project supports quick image uploads in combination with [PicGo](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo).

#### Preparation

Ensure the PicGo plugin `web-uploader` is installed.

![PicGo Configuration Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe52f47e-b2ab-4751-bb65-7ead9ebce2c0)

#### Parameter Description

- **API Address**: Local default is `http://localhost:8085/api/upload`. For server deployment, modify to `http://<server-address>:8085/api/upload`.
- **POST Parameter Name**: Default is `file`.
- **JSON Path**: Default is `data.downloadLink`.

![PicGo Configuration Example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dffeeb23-8f63-4bdb-a676-0bd693a2bede)

### Reverse Proxy

#### Caddy Configuration

```caddyfile
example.com {
    reverse_proxy /api* localhost:8080 {
        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Port {server_port}
    }
}
```

- `{scheme}`: Filled based on the actual request protocol (HTTP or HTTPS).
- `{server_port}`: Automatically obtains the port the client connects to (e.g., 443).

#### NGINX Configuration

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8085;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
